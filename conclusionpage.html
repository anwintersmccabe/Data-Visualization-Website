        <h4 class="w3-padding-10">Discussion</h4>
        <p class="w3-text-grey"> From the choropleth map it is evident that testing is much more widespread in hotspot states, or in large states such as California and Texas. From the scatterplot matrix there aren't many clearly linear trends, but it's easy to tell where most of the states' data clusters. Most states have less than 200,000 total test results, less than 10,000 cumulative hospitalizations from COVID-19, and less than 2,500 deaths from COVID-19 each. It would be easy to misinterpret this plot as showing that the Coronavirus outbreak in most states isn't very severe, however as the line graphs show most states are only about 2 months into the outbreak, which is a short time period compared to the duration of the pandemic in other countries. What the scatterplot tells us is that curve flattening measures are still necessary, and it's still too early to know what Coronavirus will do to most states without statewide safety measures. The line graphs show that most states are not yet experiencing the full effects of the outbreak, but that some states like New York are experiencing steady increases in hospitalizations as well as a slow initial increase in testing. States like California, which appears to be doing a lot of testing and producing a lot of negative results, have been able to keep hospitalization increase numbers low. </p>
        <h4 class="w3-padding-10">Limitations</h4>
          <p class="w3-text-grey"> The most significant limitation of these visualizations and the dataset overall is the lack of per capita data. Numbers of tests, hospitalizations, and deaths would be more accurate if scaled to the population of each state. Some data in .csv is also consistently incomplete, and therefore couldn't be used.  </p>
        <h4 class="w3-padding-10">Conclusion</h4>
        <p class="w3-text-grey"> These visualizations sought to answer the question of how well each state is managing the Coronavirus outbreak by examining numbers of test results, hospitalizations, and deaths in each state. If I could expand this project I would definitely use population data to scale numbers to state size for more accurate results, and also keep the project going through the summer months when it is likely to see a spike in cases as some states relax their stay at home orders and other precautions. Unfortunately, I couldn't get all of the visualizations working exactly as I wanted to- I think a better tooltip on the choropleth map and dual axes on the line graph would have been very beneficial, and if I had more time I would figure that out. This semester was difficult, but I put a lot of effort into this project and learned a lot as I was doing it even though I couldn't quite perfect my visualizations. </p>
